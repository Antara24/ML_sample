### Regression Analysis
- Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables. More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand how the value of the dependent variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc.

### Classification Algorithm
- The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.
Unlike regression, the output variable of Classification is a category, not a value, such as "Green or Blue", "fruit or animal", etc. Since the Classification algorithm is a Supervised learning technique, hence it takes labeled input data, which means it contains input with the corresponding output.
In classification algorithm, a discrete output function(y) is mapped to input variable(x).
